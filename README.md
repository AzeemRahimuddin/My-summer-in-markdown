# My-summer-in-markdown2024


### Introduction

Hi, my name is Azeem and I am a 10th grader at Chatsworth Charter High School.
I am currently apart of the cross-country team and enjoy playing sports.
On my free time when I am not studying, I enjoy playing video games and going for early morning walks.

### Summer Travel Experiences


I first went to Chicago for a couple of days to see my family and spend time with them.
After being in Chicago I took a roadtrip to Detriot, Michigan and was there for 2 nights. 
I enjoyed being there as it was a new city and I have never been there before. 
While I was there, I saw the Ford Mueseum and how they produce the F-150 trucks. 
From there, we continued driving from Detriot and went to Quebec City, Canada. 
My favorite city from the entire trip was Quebec City because of the archetecture and the different foods that was there.
Most people in Quebec speak only French so it felt very different than the rest of Canada.
One of my favorite activities in Quebec city was seeing a Maple syrup farm and how they produce it from scratch.
After, being in Quebec city for 3 days, we drove to Montreal.
In Montreal, I tried some new foods and explored the city at night.
My favorite experience in Montreal was seeing the Norte-Dame Basilica and also the Underground City.

### Sports or Physical Activities

Towards the end of the summer, I started to practice for Cross-Country (XC).
I needed to get into shape because the season starts on the first day of school.
In order to get ready for the season, I would run 1.5-2 miles every other day in order to get my endurance back up.
When running long distances, I needed to make sure that I was properly hydrated as well as having proper running form.
Having proper running form is a key to do well because it saves energy in a person's body which then lets them run longer distances.


### Summer School

The beginning of my summer was very busy as I took Geometry during the summer.
The class started 1 week after school ended and took up alot of my time.
This class started on June 17th and ended on July 19th.
The course was Monday - Friday on edgenuity and I had to spend 2-4 hours per day working on it.
The reason that I took this math class was to get ahead in math.
This class was very intense and I plan not to take another math class during the summer.


### Expectations For This Class
- Being able to expand by coding skills by learning new content and expand on what I already know. 
- Many practice assignments/review in order to master the content learned in each of the units.
- Spend time doing review on all of the units learned throughout the year in order to succeed for the AP exam.
