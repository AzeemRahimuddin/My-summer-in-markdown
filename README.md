# My-summer-in-markdown2024


### Introduction

Hi, my name is Azeem and I am a 10th grader at Chatsworth Charter High School.
I am currently apart of the cross-country team and enjoy playing sports.
On my free time when I am not studying, I enjoy playing video games and going for early morning walks.

### Summer activities

The first part of my summer was extremely boring since I took Geometry in the summer.
This class was 1 month long and took several hours everyday to complete. 
I wasnt really happy doing this, but I did it to get ahead in math.
After my class was over, I went to Chicago for a couple of days to see some family.
From there, I took a roadtrip from Chicago all the way to Quebec City, located in Canada.
I really enjoyed seeing the archetecture there as well as trying the different foods.
Most people in Quebec speak only French so it felt very different than the rest of Canada.
One of my favorite activities in Quebec city was seeing a Maple syrup farm and how they make it.
After, being in Quebec city for 3 days, we drove to Montreal.
In Montreal, I tried some new foods and explored the city at night.
My favorite experience in Montreal was seeing the Norte-Dame Basilica.
